# CUDA PCISPH

Predictive-Corrective Incompressible Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics developed for NVIDIA CUDA. It is a tool for solving Navier-Stokes' equations in a particle-based fluid simulation called Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics. This method predicts and corrects future positions for each particle forcing the fluid's imcompressibility.

## Getting Started

**NOTE**: This project can only be run on **Windows OS**.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Your machine needs to be **CUDA capable**, i.e., it needs to have a CUDA-enabled Graphics Card Unit (GPU). For more info about CUDA-enabled GPUs, please refer to [NVIDIA official developer website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) or the [CUDA page on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA).

Before proceeding with the CUDA installation, you should first intall the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with **Desktop Development with C++*. For detailed info, refer to [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsAoIqnNia4).

After the installation of Visual Studio has been succesfully completed, if you have a CUDA-capable GPU, you must install the latest version of [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). Select your OS and version accordingly, it does not matter if you choose _exe(local)_ or _exe(network)_. For detailed info and how to test installation, refer to [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL05xtTocmY).

After the installation of CUDA Toolkit, open Windows Command Prompt and type ```nvcc --version```. You should get something similar to:

Cuda compilation tools, release 10.2, V10.2.89
```

## Physical properties and initial conditions

The physical properties and initial conditions should be set in the [/props](https://github.com/ZehCoque/CUDA_PCISPH/tree/master/props) directory. Each file is self-explanatory. You may change it as you desire.

## Deployment

To deploy this project, you should build it with Visual Studio. Open ```CUDA_PCISPH.sln``` in Visual Studio, select ```Release x64``` in the solution configuration just left of the green _play button_ on the top of the screen and go to the **Solution Explorer** (keyboard shortcut ```Ctrl+Alt+L```). Right click on ```CUDA_PCISPH``` and select the ```Build``` option. After its it done, go to the same folder ```CUDA_PCISPH.sln``` is in and look for the ```\bin``` directory. Open it and go to the ```x64``` folder and look for the ```.exe``` file. This is the application. You can move this file to another directory. **Just remember** to move the ```\props``` directory as well. Double click on it to run.

## Post processing

All the simulation results will be on the ```/results``` directory, created in the same directory the ```.exe``` is located. The post processing can be done using [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/). It can read the files that end with ```.pvd``` and ```.vtu``` generated by this project. The ```.pvd``` file consists in a group of files with time correspondance and a ```.vtu``` is a single instance io time of the simulation. Open ```PCISPH.pvd``` and ```boundary.vtu``` to start post processing the simulation.
